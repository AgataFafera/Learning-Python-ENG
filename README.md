# Learning Python
This repo contains micro projects I've created to learn basic concepts of Python. My journey from beginner to advanced programmer.

The list of projects:
1) To-Do-List program allowing user to add, view and remove certain tasks and assigned hours. [to_do_list.py]
2) A program checking if a word is a palindrome. [palindromes.py]
3) A function that takes two sorted lists as input and merges them into a single sorted list. [two_sorted_list.py]
4) A function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the keys and values swapped. [dictionary_input.py]
5) A function that converts a sentence to Pig Latin (move the first letter of each word to the end and add "ay"). [pig_latin.py]
6) A fantasy name generator allowing user to generate a fictional name. [fantasy_name.py]
7) A program checking if a given number is prime number. [prime_numbs.py]
8) A simple "Guess the number" game. [guess_number.py]
9) A dice rolling simulator. [dice_roll.py]
10) A simple BMI calculator. [bmi.py]
11) A word guessing game with 3 levels of difficulty. [wordguess.py in Word Guess folder]
12) A file renamer allowing to rename multiple files at once. [renamer.py]
