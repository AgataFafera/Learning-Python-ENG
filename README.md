# Learning Python
This repo contains micro projects I've created to learn basic concepts of Python. 

The list of projects: 
1) RPG character generator creating a character with certain traits and allowing user to assign points to the abilities. 
2) To-Do-List program allowing user to add, view and remove certain tasks and assigned hours.
