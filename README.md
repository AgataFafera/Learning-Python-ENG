# Learning Python
This repo contains micro projects I've created to learn basic concepts of Python. My journey from beginner to advanced programmist.

The list of projects: 
1) RPG character generator creating a character with certain traits and allowing user to assign points to the abilities. 
2) To-Do-List program allowing user to add, view and remove certain tasks and assigned hours.
3) A program checking if a word is a palindrome.
4) A function that takes two sorted lists as input and merges them into a single sorted list.
